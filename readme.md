# Instagram UI Clone

This is a simple Instagram UI Clone made with SwiftUI.

## Getting Started

There are two branches in this repository, the `main` branch is the base version of the project while `finished-prototype` is the final result after the workshop.

If you want to follow along with the workshop, you can clone the `main` branch and follow the steps in the workshop. No worries if you get stuck, you can always check the `finished-prototype` branch to see what you missed.
